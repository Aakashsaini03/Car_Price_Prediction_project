🚗 CAR PRICE PREDICTION MODEL
📌 Overview

The Car Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a car based on factors such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and engine capacity.
This project helps buyers, sellers, and dealerships to estimate fair market values of cars.
